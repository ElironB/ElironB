# Hi, I'm Eliron

I'm a 23-year-old coder with a focus on automation, scripting, and backend systems. I spend most of my time building tools that solve real problems — automating repetitive tasks, improving workflows, or digging into system internals. Lately, I’ve been shifting more toward cybersecurity and low-level tech, and I’m looking for opportunities in that space.

Over the past year, I’ve worked directly with clients across different industries to build custom automation and optimization systems. These solutions included AI-based tools as well as more traditional backend setups to help teams save time and reduce operational noise. I handled everything from architecture to deployment, working remotely with teams across the globe.

My repos are mostly personal tools, backend experiments, or scripts in Python, Go, or TypeScript. I'm always trying to learn something new or simplify something messy.
